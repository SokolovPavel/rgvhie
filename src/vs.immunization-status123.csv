completed,	Completed,	The event has now concluded.
entered-in-error,	Entered in Error,	This electronic record should never have existed, though it is possible that real-world decisions were based on it. (If real-world activity has occurred, the status should be "stopped" rather than "entered-in-error".).
not-done,	Not Done,	The event was terminated prior to any activity beyond preparation. I.e. The 'main' activity has not yet begun. The boundary between preparatory and the 'main' activity is context-specific.
